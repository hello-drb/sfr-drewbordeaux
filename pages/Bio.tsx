                {"\"It's not just about the song. It's about the world it lives in.\""}
            </p>

            <p>
                For New York–based artist Drew Bordeaux, that world starts with the song—then expands outward. A classically trained violinist since the age of 5, his evolution from the conservatory to the club birthed a distinct sonic signature: an electric violin style that channels the grit and spirit of Jimi Hendrix, paired with a percussive acoustic guitar approach.
            </p>

            <p>
                This blend of orchestral discipline and rhythmic drive defines his sound—merging the vocal directness of Richie Havens with the songcraft of David Gray to create something both intimate and anthemically vast.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bordeaux has spent years refining that voice on stages across the Northeast. He has shared bills with artists including <strong>Daughtry</strong> and <strong>Gin Blossoms</strong>, with opening slots at venues such as The Paramount (Huntington) and Tarrytown Music Hall.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl text-ink mt-16 mb-8">The Producer & Creative Director</h2>

            <p>
                That same focus carries into the studio. As a producer, Bordeaux helps artists make cohesive records—songs, performances, and arrangements that live in the same world. He produced Becki Davis’s debut <em>Lost & Found</em> (2025), which reached #7 on the Folk Alliance International Top Albums Chart and #11 on the Top Artists Chart.
            </p>

            <p>
                He also runs <a href="https://drewimages.studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DrewImages</a>, a visual branding practice creating photography, video, and visual identity for musicians. His work has appeared in <em>Vogue</em>, <em>Billboard</em>, and <em>DownBeat</em>, and includes collaborations with Grammy-winning and nominated artists such as Jazzmeia Horn, Nicole Zuraitis, and Cyrille Aimée.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl text-ink mt-16 mb-8">Impulse / Instinct</h2>
            
            <p>
                In 2021, he released <em>Impulse / Instinct</em>, a self-produced debut that established his recorded voice. The album spans intimate songs and bigger, outward-facing ones—{"\"Alkaline\""} at the emotional center, {"\"Last Son\""} capturing the moment it was written in—and includes a bold reworking of Genesis’s {"\"Land of Confusion.\""}
